This tampermonkey script gives the ability to change your discord in app icon which is a nitro only feature. The old manual scripts have been deprecated and this new [script](https://github.com/patrickzhou1234/DiscordIconChanger/blob/main/script.js) allows you to normally go into settings on discord, then appearances and click on the icon that you want. Simply use this tampermonkey script and go to appearance settings!
